# Pregnancy-Fetal-Health-Risk-Prediction
A dual-model machine learning project aiming to improve maternal and fetal healthcare through predictive analytics. We built two separate classifiers:  PredictRisk: Predicts pregnancy risk levels (low, mid, high) using maternal physiological parameters.  Fetal Health Classifier: Assesses fetal health condition based on cardiotocograms (CTG).
